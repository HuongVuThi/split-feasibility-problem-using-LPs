Split feasibility problem: Using LPs as subproblems

Abstract. In this note, we examine how linear programs (LPs) can be used as subproblems in finding solutions to a split feasibility problem (SFP). First, SFP is reformulated as a nonlinear convex optimization problem with smooth objective. Then, a gradient projection method is applied. The method requires computing projections onto convex sets in each steps. We show that if the sets are bounded polyhedrons, then LPs can be used to find the projections and thus the gradient projection method can be implemented easily.
